# Raw-Python
Raw Python Projects:
My personal collection of python codes and experiments

Mostly of them are chunk of code that could be easily used for bigger projects or, anyway, to find inspiration.

I'm really going from level 0 topics and exercises to more complex ones, such as ML or DDOS attacks.
